Today I learnt a valuable lesson on clean code. In the first Exercise I got confused on a for loop and tried to do it without it.
Which made the code much longer and confusing. As it is also not looping, it caused me to specify each other requirement one by one.
Later when I moved on to the next Excersizes, which moves on top of the first one, the code just got more confusing. 
The last version on the Exercise 2 was working for the specific case, but it is hard to know if it would work on other test cases.
When the Exercise 3 was displayed, I knew it would not work in the case. Thus I wrote the for loop in the beginning for the 3rd case.
Although I still had to put all specifications from Exercise 2 to the Exercise 3. Because they were not build on the same functions.
The last verison of the Exercise 3 failed. Although it would probably work for some test cases, it would often keep failing.
My next steps would have been:
1. Start the Exercise 1 and get rid of all specific cases at the beginning
2. Replace all the if/else conditions with a for loop
3. In Exercise 2: I would also not remove elements and append again, but use the for loop to change elements in lists
4. In that case, I believe Exercise 3 would not be much different then the Exercise 2
